It is difficult to find absolutely natural environments, and it is common that the naturalness varies in a continuum, from ideally 100% Natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of Naturalness is not uniform.[3] If, for instance, we take an agricultural field, and consider the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil, we will find that whereas the first is quite similar to that of an undisturbed forest soil, the structure is quite different.
