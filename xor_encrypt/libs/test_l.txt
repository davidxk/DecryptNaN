A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the biosphere on Earth, and properties common to these organisms-plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria-are a carbon- and water-based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce and, through Natural selection, adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.
