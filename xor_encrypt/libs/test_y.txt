"The world we inhabit is an orderly one, in which things generally behave in predictable ways, Aristotle argued, because every natural object has a "nature"-an attribute (associated primarily with form)that makes the object behave in its customary fashion..."[7] Aristotle recommended four causes as appropriate for the business of the natural philosopher, or physicist, "and if he refers his problems back to all of them, he will assign the 'why' in the way proper to his science-the matter, the form, the mover, [and] 'that for the sake of which'". While the vagrancies of the material cause are subject to circumstance, the formal, efficient and final cause often coincide because in Natural kinds, the mature form and final cause are one and the same. The capacity to mature into a specimen of one's kind is directly acquired from "the primary source of motion", i.e., from one's father, whose seed (sperma) conveys the essential nature (common to the species), as a hypothetical ratio.[8]
