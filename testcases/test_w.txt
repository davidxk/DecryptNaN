The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[56][57][58] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.[59] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by Natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.
