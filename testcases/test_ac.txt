Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from Greek and Arabic into Latin.[29] The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.[30] European inventions such as the horseshoe, horse collar and crop rotation allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day France and England.[31] Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian theology developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.[32] This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as heresy.[32] By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.[33] Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.[33] These works were taught at new universities in Paris and Oxford by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.[34] A 1210 decree from the Synod of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on Natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."[34]
